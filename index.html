                    <div class="card-content">
                        I have always enjoyed physical activities with special notice to sports. I grew up playing soccer and also enjoyed casual games of football, basketball and hockey. While my time for these is lessened due to being a parent, college student and worker, I still find time to be active in one or another from time to time.

                    </div>
                    Since I was a child, video games have been a large part of my life. Even now as a parent, college student, and full-time employee, I find time a few times a week and play 30 minutes to relax. I do like the visuals of newer games but classic 8bit and 16bit games will always be my favorite. I most enjoy platform and fighting games.

                        I have always enjoyed outdoor activities and when not playing competitive sports I enjoy a nice relaxing fishing trip. I find the calmness and serenity of being on or at a lake to be truly fulfilling and a great way to reduce stress during difficult times. I try to go out at least a few times a month during the summer and fall. I do keep the legal fish I catch and cook some delicious meals from them.

                        Humor

                    <div class="card-content">
                        I have always tried to defuse a tense situation while well timed bits of humor. I have always tried to be the tension breaker in a situation and have more often than not succeeded. It could be a situation during a gathering or perhaps a work related situation, I will assess the situation and attempt to make it less awkward with a mix of sarcastic or observational wit. Each of these may reference a well know movie or television show. Understandibly it can fall flat as no humor attempt hits 100%. Due to this experience informally I am used to broker peace between friends or relatives at times.

                        Creativity

                    <div class="card-content">
                        One of the biggest reasons I am trying to change careers this late is that working in customer service doesn't allow for any creativity which I really would like. One of my biggest goals from childhood is to create a profitable board game or card game even if it seems these types of games will never be as popular as they used to be. I like to apply new ideas to things and see how well it works and make adjustments as needed. I hope to pursue a career in web design as I found this to be the most enjoyable of my courses so far.

                    <div class="card-content">
                        I consider myself an excellent test taker and prefer taking tests to other types of skill assessments. I have never gotten worse than 85% on any test in my life and strive to always achieve good results on them. I will continue to try to implement this in regular homework and other career development programs.
